Steps To Make :
              1. Wash the taken Chicken Thoroughly At least 3 times.

              2. Clean it with a Tissue to remove extra Moisture.

              3. Take a bowl (add Red Chilli powder, Egg, Maida, CornFlour,Turmeric Powder, Ginger-Garlic paste, Chicken Masala, Salt, Juice Of Lemon, Curd, ) Mix every thing Given.

              4. Take the Mint/Coriander/Curry leaves and make it as a paste in grinder or a Mixer.

              5. Now add the Chicken Pieces to the bowl where we done the mixture.

              6. Coat them well with batter.

              7. Marinate The Chicken for (Min. 2 hours/ Max. 8 hours).

              8. After Marination Mix the batter well.

              9. Now, Deep fry the Chicken Pieces.

              10. Keep the Flame While Dropping the pieces into the pan 

              11. Do not overload the pan otherwise, the oil temperature will be reduced as the chicken pieces absorb to much oil.

              12. Now reduce the flame to medium Hot.

              13. Fry them evenly on the both sides turning occasionally.

              14. Once It turns Golden Brown in Colour, Drain it on paper towel.
